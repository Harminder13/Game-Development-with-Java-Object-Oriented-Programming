# 🎯 **GuessMaster: Java to Android Transition**  

This repository showcases the evolution of **GuessMaster** — a game originally developed in **Java** to demonstrate advanced object-oriented programming concepts, including **inheritance**, **abstract classes**, and **polymorphism**. The project highlights my ability to transition from a console-based Java application to a fully functional Android app with an intuitive graphical interface.
